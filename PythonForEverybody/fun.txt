There are two definitions of “hacker”. A hacker is a person who studies a system (such as the rules of a cipher or a piece of software) to understand it so well that they are not limited by the original rules of that system and can creatively modify it to work in new ways. “Hacker” is also used to mean criminals who break into computer systems, violate people’s privacy, and cause damage. This book uses “hacker” in the first sense. Hackers are cool. Criminals are just people who think they’re being clever by breaking stuff. Personally, my day job as a software developer pays me way more for less work than writing a virus or doing an Internet scam would.
On a side note, don’t use any of the encryption programs in this book for your actual files. They’re fun to play with but they don’t provide true security. And in general, you shouldn’t trust the ciphers that you yourself make. As legendary cryptographer Bruce Schneier put it, “Anyone, from the most clueless amateur to the best cryptographer, can create an algorithm that he himself can’t break. It’s not even hard. What is hard is creating an algorithm that no one else can break, even after years of analysis. And the only way to prove that is to subject the algorithm to years of analysis by the best cryptographers around.”
