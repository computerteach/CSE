"""class: Classes are a user-defined data type that is used to encapsulate data and associated functions together. It also helps in binding data together into a single unit.
Data Member: A variable or memory location name that holds value to does a specific task within a program.
Member Function: They are the functions, usually a block of a code snippet that is written to re-use it.
Instance variable: A variable that is defined inside a method of a class.
Function Overloading: This technique is used to assign multiple tasks to a single function, and the tasks are performed based on the number of arguments or the type of argument the function has.
Operator Overloading: It is the technique of assigning multiple functions/tasks to a particular operator.
Inheritance: It is the process of acquiring the properties of one class to another, i.e., one class can acquire the properties of another.
Instantiation: It is the technique of creating an instance of a class."""
